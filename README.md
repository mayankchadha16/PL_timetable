# Input Data Handling
### Reading from Text File
In our initial approach, we successfully read input data line by line from a text file. However, we encountered challenges when trying to convert string inputs into lists. As a result, we had to abandon this approach and seek alternative solutions.

### Obtaining Input from Terminal
We were able to successfully obtain input data from the terminal for *list_of_courses* and *list_of_student*. However, we faced difficulties in obtaining input data from the terminal for the *student_to_course* data.

### Final Outcome 
We will **change the inputs in the *timetable.ml* files before running the code** as we are maintaining uniformity since the other option of taking *list_of_courses* and *list_of_student* as input from terminal and *student_to_course* data by altering the inputs in the *timetable.ml* looks clumsy. Therefore pass your inputs in the *timetable.ml* as illustrated in that file itself.
